# Aayush Agarwal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website built with Bootstrap. It highlights my experience, skills and selected projects and can easily be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or fork it under your GitHub account.
2. Edit the content in `index.html` to include your own information.
3. Customize styles in `style.css` if desired.
4. Add or modify projects and experiences directly in the HTML.
5. Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will automatically host your site at `https://<username>.github.io/`.

## Features
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap Icons.
- Hero section with call-to-action.
- Dark mode toggle with preference saved in `localStorage`.
- Scrollspy navigation highlighting your current section.
- Sections for About, Skills, Work Experience, Projects, and Contact.

Feel free to extend the site with your own features and designs.
